# multiscale_neuromod


This repository contains the TensorFlow implementation of the paper "Effects of neuromodulation-inspired mechanisms on the performance of deep neural networks in a spatial learning task".  
The base model is inspired by Banino et al., 2018: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0102-6.
